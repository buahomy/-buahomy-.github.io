## **Final Project Proposal: Intro to Data Science (CS-215)**

### **Exploration of NLP and Fake News Detection**

As part of my final project for the Intro to Data Science class (CS-215) in Spring 2025, I aim to explore the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by implementing a **Fake News Detector Algorithm**. My goal is to analyze patterns in fake and real news articles and visualize the results using various techniques.

### **Data Sources for Fake News Detection**

1. **Kaggle Fake News Detection Datasets**  
   This dataset contains two CSV files (`fake.csv` and `true.csv`) with politics-related news that I hope to use for training my model.

2. **Hugging Face Pre-Trained Model**  
   To enhance the algorithm, I plan to leverage transfer learning using Hugging Face's pre-trained model, which captures sentiment and context effectively.

## **AI-Generated Image Detector**

With the rise of AI-generated media from platforms like OpenAI, distinguishing real from synthetic media has become increasingly challenging. For my second project idea, I aim to develop an **AI-Generated Image Detector** that identifies whether an image is real or AI-generated. 

### **Data Sources for AI-Generated Image Detection**

1. **OpenXLab Fake Image Dataset**  
   This open-source dataset includes folders `ImageData` (containing compressed fake image datasets) and `MetaData` (labeling information).  
   [Link to Dataset](https://openxlab.org.cn/datasets/whlzy/FakeImageDataset/tree/main)

2. **Hugging Face Fake Image Dataset**  
   An alternative dataset hosted on Hugging Face, providing similar labeling and metadata.

3. **Kaggle CIFAKE Dataset**  
   This dataset contains 60,000 synthetically-generated images and 60,000 real images. It also provides an opportunity to share and optimize my work alongside other practitioners.
